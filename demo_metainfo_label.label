# This is a comment line.
# Empty lines should be ignored.
# Each non-comment line in this file should be formatted as follows:
#
#       <FRAME_NUM> <LABEL>
# 
# <FRAME_NUM> is an integer identifying the frame by its order of appearance in the video.
#   For ease of readibility and compliance with the naming standards that we use in 
#   directories containing frames, each number should be 6 characters wide.
#    
# <LABEL> can be any of the following:
#   EMPTY
#       -indicates that it is clear to the labeler that the frame contains no obstacles.
#   UNCERTAIN
#       -indicates that it is difficult to judge if an obstacle is visible or not.
#   <NUM> [(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3),(x4,y4)]...
#       -<NUM> indicates the number of ROIs identified by the labeler.
#       -It is followed by a space and a comma-separated list of convex polygons, each
#         defined within a set of square brackets. There should be <NUM> pairs of square
#         brackets. If not, the file is malformed.
#       -Within the square brackets, a convex polygon is specified by a comma-separated
#         set of points.
